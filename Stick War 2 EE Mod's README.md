# Stick War 2: Enhanced Edition Mod

`Stick War 2: Enhanced Edition Mod` is a campaign-focused overhaul of `Stick War 2` that expands boss fights, improves enemy behavior, adds new level events, rebalances campaign progression, replayable levels and fixes several bugs/performance issues from the original game.

This mod is built for players who want the original campaign to feel more dramatic, more reactive, and more boss-heavy while still keeping the classic Stick War 2 feel.

Difficulty affects more than basic enemy strength in this mod:
- `Normal`
  - Recommended for a first playthrough.
  - Boss fights are still stronger than the original game, but more forgiving.
- `Hard`
  - Enemy waves and boss pressure are stronger.
  - Reinforcement timing and army pressure are less forgiving.
- `Insane`
  - Intended for players who already know the campaign.
  - Bosses, reinforcements, and enemy pressure are at their most punishing.

Some boss encounters and reinforcement waves scale by difficulty, so the campaign may feel noticeably different between modes.

### Boss Ability Queue

In levels like Rebels United(Westwind) where you fight all bosses at once, only up to 3 bosses can use special abilities at the same time. The active queue lasts 10 seconds, then rotates to another set of bosses. Bosses outside the queue still attack normally, but their special abilities are temporarily paused. This keeps fights balanced, readable, and less performance-heavy.

Boss selection uses fair weighted randomness. On the first wave, all living bosses have an equal chance to be selected. After a boss is selected, its chance is lowered for the next queue, while bosses that were not selected become more likely to rotate in later. This keeps ability usage varied without letting every boss spam abilities at once.

## Ambush Levels

Ambush levels are survival-based encounters where you defend against timed enemy waves until reinforcements arrive. You cannot push past the barrier, and fog of war hides the enemy base.

### Ambush: Native Tribes
Scattered native tribes attack from the hills with Speartons and Swordwraths wielding tribal weapons. They have reduced health but come in large numbers across 5 waves. After 150 seconds, reinforcements arrive to help you finish the fight.

### Ambush: Shadowrath Stalkers
Assassins emerge from the dark under a night overlay. Shadowraths stalk your position and unlock cloak ability after 90 seconds, becoming invisible as they approach the barrier. 5 waves of increasing pressure.

### Ambush: Rebels Last Stand
The rebels gather everything they have for one final push. An opening cutscene reveals their full army before a single massive wave attacks. After defeating them, an ending cutscene shows rebels being intercepted by chaos forces.

### Ambush: Undead Horde
The undead pour across the battlefield in a poisoned swarm. An opening cutscene shows a Marrowkai raising the dead. 4 waves of Undead variants (Spearton, Archer, Ninja, Magikill) followed by a 400 HP Marrowkai boss. Units can be infected — only garrison cures infection.

### Ambush: The Storm
Rain and lightning obscure the battlefield. Enemy units are only visible during thunder flashes. Stoned unit decorations litter the map. 6 waves with breathing periods between them, featuring Cats, Knights, Dead, Undead, Skelators, Wingidons, and Giants.

**Common mechanics:**
- Fog of war locks forward vision to a barrier line
- Player units cannot cross the barrier
- Reinforcements spawn after surviving ~150 seconds
- Win by surviving all waves and eliminating enemy combat units
- Wave sizes scale with difficulty (Normal / Hard / Insane)

## Playable Bosses

Unlock boss units through the upgrade tree and toggle **Boss Mode** to produce them instead of regular units. See the Boss Roster and Boss Abilities sections for full ability details.

### Boss Mode Rules

## AI Improvements

- Enemy campaign strategy now reacts better to army advantage and disadvantage.
- Hidden Shadowrath forces are counted more intelligently.
- Shadowrath disguise/trap behavior is more coordinated.
- Boss support units stay more relevant around their boss.
- Enemy reinforcements are less likely to be instantly deleted on spawn.
- Expensive AI scans were reduced or cached where possible.

## Bug Fixes and Polish

- Fixed multiple boss health bar issues caused by damage-reduction-only stat changes.
- Fixed Reaper Control cleanup so units return to normal after control ends.
- Fixed Reaper-controlled units hitting flying units when they should not.
- Fixed Magikill friendly-fire spell behavior while Reaper-controlled.
- Fixed Poison Fists behavior so the fist hit applies poison while the effect stays visual.
- Fixed campaign map update logic and prewarm behavior.
- Fixed several Shadowrath disguise edge cases.
- Fixed startup intro loading errors by handling failed intro loads safely.

## Performance Notes

This mod includes a lot of new boss logic, but several heavy debug and repeated-update systems were removed or reduced before release:

- Reduced repeated AI target scans through caching.
- Reduced repeated campaign map UI updates.
- Reduced repeated tutorial/enemy command spam.

Normal debug keybind checks are lightweight and only run deeper checks while `Shift` is held.

## Music Notes

Campaign levels use a mix of:

- `battleOfTheShadowElves`
- `enteringTheStronghold`
- `chaosInGame`
- `fieldOfMemories`

The final Medusa level starts with `battleOfTheShadowElves` and later switches to `fieldOfMemories` during the true boss fight.

## Requirements

- Windows is recommended.
- Standalone Flash Player projector is required.
- Included projector: `flashplayer_32_sa.exe`
- Game file: `Stick_War_2_Upgrades.swf`

## Notes for Players

- This is a campaign overhaul, not a full new game.
- Some encounters are intentionally harder than the original campaign.
- Boss fights are designed around pressure, reinforcements, and phase behavior.
- If something feels unusually broken, save your file and report the level, difficulty, and what happened.
